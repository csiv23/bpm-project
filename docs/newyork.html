            <b>Specific Important Dates for Black Popular Music in NYC: </b> <br> <br>

            1934: The Apollo Theater opens and becomes a cultural and musical mecca in the heart of the Harlem
            neighborhood in NYC <br> <br>

            1963: James Brown’s Live At the Apollo (recorded at the Harlem landmark on October 24, 1962) is released in
            May and is a crossover smash, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard album chart (and lodging on said chart for 66
            weeks). In the One: The Life and Music of James Brown, RJ Smith noted that the record was “so staggeringly
            new it scarcely bore any connection to the music called rhythm and blues. Here was the new soul of the
            music.” After the success of the album, Brown said, “I started seeing different things and my brain started
            to intercept new ideas. I became a big city thinker.” <br> <br>
