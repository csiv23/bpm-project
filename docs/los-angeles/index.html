            <p> <b>Artists:</b>
                DJ Yella, MC Ren, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Eazy E
            <p>
                <br>
            <p>
                <b>Before Formation:</b>
            <p>Easy E, Eric Right, co-owned Ruthless Records, which he started with his own $5,000 from selling Boyz n
                the
                Hood singles in Compton and drug money. Ice Cube didn’t have much of a solo career prior, as he was just
                getting noticed and starting to work with Dr.Dre. Dr. Dre was a DJ before anything, and got his start
                playing at Eve at Night and, “Andre would manually record songs straight off the radio, and layer them
                together with a four-track recorder. The crude technique let him bring to life the mash-ups he’d
                imagined.”
                (East of Eden) Also created the World Class Wrecking crew which Dj Yella was apart of. </p>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Formation:</b>
            <p>Easy E would first go on to recruit Ice Cube and Dr. Dre wrote for the label, which DJ Yella and MC Ren
                followed suit. The group formed in 1986, which took time to fully form and add the additions of MC Ren
                and
                DJ Yella. DJ Yella was just as important although he was not one of the rappers, Yella would produce the
                albums behind N.W.A Which, “Straight of Compton”, released in 1988 made the biggest hit in terms of
                N.W.A’s
                success. This song exhibits how young black men in the Compton area of LA are economically and racially
                oppressed. (Was thinking about using specific lyrics what yall think?) Although MC Ren was the last
                addition
                and fresh from high school, it was said that he had revamped N.W.A’s sound, “bringing in many of the
                noisy,
                extreme sonic innovations of Public Enemy and adopting a self-consciously violent and dangerous lyrical
                stance.”(All Music). Which further politically charged music came, like “Fuck the Police”, which had
                actually placed the Rap Group on an FBI watch list. After Ice Cube had left, the sound shifted into more
                of
                “Eazy's near-parodic lyrics and Dre's increasingly subtle and complex productions.” Interestingly
                enough,
                :(Efil4zaggin was teeming with dense, funky soundscapes and ridiculously violent and misogynist lyrics.
                Naturally, the lyrics provoked outrage from many critics and conservative watchdogs, but that only
                increased
                the group's predominantly male, white suburban audience”(All Music). Which illustrates how the possible
                conflict between Ice Cube and the label was that Ice Cube was not making music solely for the money, and
                the
                fact the sound was shifting to cater to white audiences. This was the peak of N.W.A’s popularity, but
                Dr.
                Dre was the next to leave. This was also due to the fact of what Dr. Dre felt like underpaid as well and
                this was an unfair record deal. </p>
            </p> <br>

            <p>
                <b>Fall Out:</b>
            <p>In 89, Ice Cube was the first artist to break away from the group. On one side of the coin, others in the
                label were saying Ice Cube’s charged lyrics were resulting in the label losing money. Yet, Ice Cube felt
                that he was not being paid enough and turned to solo work. After leaving he immediately wrote a diss
                track directed towards Ruthless Records. Which he continued using his heavily charged lyrics, for
                instance his first project after N.W.A was Amerikkkas Most Wanted and with the connection to the FBI
                list the title is self explanatory. He would also move into the film industry, with his first Movie
                being Boyz in the Hood which catapulted his acting career. After N.W.A Dr. Dre would go on to form Death
                Row Records with Suge Knight and the D.O.C., which would become one of the most successful rap record
                labels, this was after Suge Knight had to reportedly threaten the managers of Ruthless Records to let
                Dr. Dre out of his contract. Beef between Dr.Dre and Easy was a constant back and forth for the years to
                come after the formation of Death Row. Both artists dropping projects of their own and cementing their
                solo careers, and the feud between each other. This would only last a few years as Easy E had passed
                away due to aids in 95 and the two of them, and Ice Cube, had made up before Easy’s passing. MC Ren
                stayed with Ruthless Records after the breakup of N.W.A to drop solo albums and write for Eazy E.Yet, MC
                Ren did not receive the mainstream success Easy, Dre, and Cube had seen after the full split up of N.W.A
                in `1992. DJ Yella would go on to stay with ruthless records producing for the record label. After Easy
                had passed, DJ Yella released his first solo album in 1996 which was not as successful as Yella had
                wanted and is when he had made a career decision into Porn. </p>
