                        Although Houston is a diverse cultural mosaic today, it wasn’t always like that. But now, when
                        people spend time in Houston, they forget they’re in the South! This is because Houston has
                        grown to appreciate and love what it has: peoples and cultures. It wasn’t easy using these
                        resources to become the beautiful cohort we are today though, people had to endure hardship for
                        where we are today. Many of these people were Black people who were struggling financially. Gold
                        Star Recording Studios changed that though, Gold Star Recording Studios enabled people who knew
                        they had the artist in them and encouraged them to explore that artist. By extension, this
                        helped a lot of people out of unhealthy financial situations they were locked in due to the
                        economic inequality that plagues all communities of the U.S. Some of these individuals include
                        Brian McKnight, Carl Mitchell, Solange Knowles, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Hubert Laws,
                        and Beyonce.

                        Before diving into the man known as King of the Bayou, King of the South, and King of Zydeco,
                        I’d like to highlight some of his awards as a result of the strides he made in proving that
                        Black Popular Music can fight economic inequality. Several of these awards include the National
                        Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, a place in the Blues Hall of
                        Fame, an album considered by the Library of Congress to be "culturally, historically, or
                        artistically significant" and selected it for preservation in the National Recording Registry.
                        Clifton Chenier was most famous for playing his folksy accordion. He traveled all over the
                        nation, but, he really made a difference down in Texas. Clifton Chenier made his way to Texas
                        and played in different blues clubs, trying to get more people involved to grow both his wealth,
                        and the blues. Chenier’s contributions to fighting against economic inequality live on in the
                        spirit that drives successful blues clubs today. Chenier paved a road that allowed blue and folk
                        musicians to explore their art and not have to worry about finances.

                        Rober Davis Jr. or better known by his stage name, DJ Screw, was a writer, rapper, producer, and
                        visionary who explored his art and defied society in Houston. DJ Screw began his career when he
                        was just 12 years old where he first discovered his slowed down mixes. After a few friends
                        bought some his mixtapes, several community memebers were in awe and began requesting his tapes.
                        Once Robert had a little money and a gig going, he began inviting some of Houston’s MCs that
                        lived their lives on the south side of Houston to rap and/or freestyle on some of his mixes.
                        This lead to the founding of Houston’s Screwed Up Clicked which included several musicians who
                        became prominent figures in the community. DJ Screw’s music and passion for bringing people
                        together enabled these individuals to come together and pave a new path for new Black Music. By
                        extension, DJ Screw paved a path for those who are economically disadvantaged to explore
                        themselves and their art within and capitalize money and community off of it.
