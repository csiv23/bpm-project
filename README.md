## Economic Inequality 

Of the many pertinent global topics of today, one at the forefront of conversations is economic inequality. In the United States in 2021, “the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989” (Siripurapu). As a result, this issue is not only on the rise, but is significantly higher than nearly all other developed nations. While there are efforts to make change and reverse these statistics, this problem is not an easy fix. Economists credit this rise in economic inequality to other social issues including racial and gender discrimination. Because of all this, it is imperative that we unite as communities and as a nation to make a difference. With this website, we seek to kickstart this change by including research conducted across 4 critical U.S. cities and blending together the themes of economic inequality and black music combatting it one community at a time. In doing this, we seek to show the progression of these two elements through time, and ultimately bring attention to economic inequalities in Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City, Houston, and all other communities across the United States.
