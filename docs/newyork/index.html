            <p id="text">
                1934: The Apollo Theater opens and becomes a cultural and musical mecca in the heart of the Harlem
                neighborhood in NYC <br> <br> <br>

                1955: Marian Anderson is the first black singer to perform with the New York Metropolitan Opera <br>
                <br> <br>

                1963: James Brown’s Live At the Apollo (recorded at the Harlem landmark on October 24, 1962) is released
                in
                May and is a crossover smash, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard album chart (and lodging on said chart for
                66
                weeks). In the One: The Life and Music of James Brown, RJ Smith noted that the record was “so
                staggeringly
                new it scarcely bore any connection to the music called rhythm and blues. Here was the new soul of the
                music.” After the success of the album, Brown said, “I started seeing different things and my brain
                started
                to intercept new ideas. I became a big city thinker.” <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <h1>Relation to Economic Inequality:
            </h1> <br> <br>
            <div id="text" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
                <p> Through these times, economic inequality has been a centralized theme within communities in New
                    York. Today, approximately one in every five New Yorkers lives in poverty and nearly half the city’s
                    households are considered poor. Additionally, the average income for white families in New York
                    state was $122,000 during the 2014-15 period, 77 percent greater than the average family income for
                    blacks ($69,100) and 93 percent greater than the average for Latino families ($63,500). Because of
                    this, the higher average incomes for whites means that white families account for nearly 71 percent
                    of all family income in the state, while they represent only 60 percent of all families. Blacks and
                    Latinos have smaller income shares than their share of families, and 63 percent of these black
                    families are in the bottom half of the income distribution, while 70 percent of Latino families are
                    in the bottom half.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> While these statistics show economic inequality within New York as it is today, these trends aren’t
                    new.
                    Financially, New York has been racially divided for decades, and this division has presented itself
                    through music through these decades.</p>
