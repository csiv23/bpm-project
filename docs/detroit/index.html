                        In the early 1900s, Big Band Jazz was a popular form of music in the city of Detroit and across
                        the
                        country. Though its difficult to isolate the origin of Big Band Jazz, a few Detroit bands
                        certainly
                        played a large role in its popularity as pioneers, such as McKinney’s Cotton Pickers.

                        With the rise of Rock N Roll across the nation, the blues scene in Detroit began to fade. In
                        this era, Berry Gordy’s Motown Records was founded as the Motown genre grew popular. Detroit had
                        a significant contribution to the popularity of Rock N Roll as well. Hank Ballard & the
                        Midnighters . Bill Haley solidified Detroit’s contributions with his famous “Rock Around the
                        Clock”

                        With the success of Motown Records, Detroit began to form its own brand of soul music. The most
                        notable act was Aretha Franklin. Crowned the “Queen of Soul” she was a pioneer in early soul and
                        is regarded as one of the greatest vocalists of all time. Motown Records saw great success in
                        this era. Many great artists such as Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, and Martha Reeves rose to
                        prominence at this time.

                        Sean Anderson, better known as Big Sean, speaks on the significance of receiving his “first
                        chain”. In this song income inequality is explored through Big Sean’s first-hand experience. His
                        disadvantaged background makes his “first chain” a special, monumental moment for him as both an
                        artist and a person who had little growing up.

                        <div id="analysis1"> In the first few lines of the song Anderson touches on his disadvantaged
                            background. He speaks on the hostile environment of inner-city Detroit where gun violence is
                            rampant. In American cities, there gun violence has a strong correlation with poverty.
                            Though this line speaks on gun violence, in these communities, gun violence goes
                            hand-in-hand with economic inequality. This is a theme strong in the current Detroit hip-hop
                            scene. Rappers often discuss gun violence and its relation to economic inequality. Anderson
                            also alludes to the famous Tupac Shakur book “The Rose that Grew from Concrete”. Anderson
                            draws a parallel between his economically disadvantaged upbringing and concrete.</div>

                        </div>
                        <div id="analysis2">Anderson discusses his living conditions while growing up in Detroit where
                            he was forced to shower in mildew. Mold is caused by humidity and moisture and can be
                            dangerous for certain allergic groups. It is not advised to live in or shower in mildew but
                            in economically disadvantaged communities this is not uncommon. Sean Anderson speaks on how
                            once upon a time, he had to shower in mildew and contrasts his upbringing to his current
                            affluence. Braggadocious rap is a very common style in both historical and in contemporary
                            rap. This is often discussed in contrast with the upbringing of the rap artists as Anderson
                            does here. He once had to shower mildew, so he is proud to now own a penthouse. All the
                            while, Anderson acknowledges that at his core, he is still the same person.</div>

                        In Saturn, Stevie Wonders explores the idea of escaping the tragedies of earth perpetuated by
                        those in power. In moving to the planet Saturn, Wonder uses Saturn as a symbol of a utopian
                        society. Wonder and many of his contemporaries often expressed Afro-futurist ideals such as
                        those explored in this song. Romanticizing the extraterrestrial is an essential aspect of
                        Afro-futurism. Throughout the track, Wonder alludes to several problems in the world today
                        including subliminal references to issues related to economic inequality. The idea of escaping
                        earth to Saturn would be to the benefit of the marginalized societies of earth who are most
                        often suffering from economic inequality in one form or another.

                            initiated and participated in as a “strategy for peace”. Given that this song was released
                            in 1976, Wonder is most likely referencing the numerous wars the U.S. fought in Asia during
                            the 60s and 70s. Much of the general U.S. population was not certain why these wars were
                            being fought, leading to protests across the country. Ultimately these wars lead to the
                            deaths of thousands, including innocent villagers. These wars disproportionately affect the
                            poor. Scarce resources immediately affect those with little income.</div>

                    <img class="genre-image" id="hooker" src="../images/hooker.jpg" alt="John Lee Hooker">

                    <p class="genre-text">
                        In Hobo Blues, John Lee Hooker sings about a person who runs away from home and begins a life as
                        a “hobo”. The song is sung in first-person, but it is unclear if Hooker is speaking about
                        himself. Hooker ran away from home at a young age so it is possible the song is about his
                        personal experience. In any case, Hooker explains that the character freighthops—a term that
                        refers to illegally traveling across the country via freight train. This was a practice common
                        for those without the funds to travel across the nation legally. The practice was most common
                        during the Great Depression but continued for decades after. Freighthopping was most common for
                        the economically disadvantaged.

                            I took a freight train to be my friend, oh Lord (0:16)
                        </div>
                        <div id="analysis1"> Hooker describes that the character sought to live a life as a “hobo”.
                            Though the term hobo is colloquially used to describe a penniless vagabond, its original
                            meaning referred to a migratory worker. The character that Hooker describes left home and
                            sought to find work elsewhere by traveling via freight train. The character is poor and
                            searching for a means of income. Hooker’s story puts the listener in the point-of-view of
                            this economically disadvantaged individual and forces the listener to examine life from this
                            perspective. </div>

                        </div>
                        <div id="analysis2"> In this line Hooker paints a picture of a weeping mother whose child has
                            run away from home. Hooker shows the harsh reality of economic inequality. The character in
                            this song ran away from home in search of a better source of income, leaving his or her
                            mother in despair. As mentioned before, Hooker ran away from home as a young child, himself.
                            It is rumored that he never saw his mother again. It seems that Hooker draws on his own
                            experience to demonstrate the problems and issues that economic inequality can lead to.
