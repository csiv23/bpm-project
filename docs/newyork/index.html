            <h1>Specific Important Dates for Black Popular Music in NYC: </h1> <br> <br>
            <p id="text">
                1934: The Apollo Theater opens and becomes a cultural and musical mecca in the heart of the Harlem
                neighborhood in NYC <br> <br> <br>

                1955: Marian Anderson is the first black singer to perform with the New York Metropolitan Opera <br>
                <br> <br>

                1963: James Brown’s Live At the Apollo (recorded at the Harlem landmark on October 24, 1962) is released
                in
                May and is a crossover smash, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard album chart (and lodging on said chart for
                66
                weeks). In the One: The Life and Music of James Brown, RJ Smith noted that the record was “so
                staggeringly
                new it scarcely bore any connection to the music called rhythm and blues. Here was the new soul of the
                music.” After the success of the album, Brown said, “I started seeing different things and my brain
                started
                to intercept new ideas. I became a big city thinker.” <br> <br> <br> <br>
